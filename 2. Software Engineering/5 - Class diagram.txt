The Class Diagram is crucial in object-oriented design as it provides a structural overview of the system, depicting the classes, their attributes, methods, relationships, and interactions. Here's why it's important:

1. **Visualizing System Structure:** Class Diagrams offer a visual representation of the system's structure, including classes, their attributes, and relationships, aiding in understanding the system's architecture.

2. **Design Clarity:** They provide clarity in defining the system's entities (classes) and their interactions, facilitating better design decisions and system understanding among developers and stakeholders.

3. **Modelling Relationships:** Class Diagrams show how classes are related through associations, aggregations, or inheritances, helping in understanding the dependencies between different parts of the system.

4. **Basis for Code Generation:** They serve as a foundation for generating code, providing a blueprint for software development based on defined classes and their interactions.

Now, let's draw a Class Diagram for the online taxi booking system:
